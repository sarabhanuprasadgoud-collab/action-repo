Overview
This project is part of the Techstax Developer Assessment. It demonstrates integration between GitHub Actions, Webhooks, Flask, MongoDB, and a UI that polls for updates every 15 seconds.
The solution is split into two repositories:
• action-repo → A dummy repository to trigger GitHub events (push, pull_request, merge).
• webhook-repo → A Flask application that receives webhook events, stores them in MongoDB, and serves them to a minimal UI.
